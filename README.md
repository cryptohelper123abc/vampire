# Vampire (VAMP)

Vampire (VAMP) is a fair launched & deflationary token designed to have big buybacks and burns by incorporating a Jackpot system.

The Jackpot is a large payout to the last purchasing address, but if the Jackpot hits the hard limit of $100,000, 
70% is bought back and burned during Morbin Time, raising the price floor.

The Jackpot delivers FTM meaning both your money in VAMP and your winnings in the Jackpot are safe from a sudden sale.

The Jackpot is awarded to the last buyer of VAMP that has been the last buyer for 10 minutes. 
Anyone can purchase VAMP to become the new last buyer and reset the timer to 10 minutes. 
A $10 purchase of VAMP is required to win the Jackpot.

The Jackpot and Morbin Time bring up the price floor as VAMP is bought back and burned.
New buyers are incentivized because there is always a Jackpot to be won.
Sellers are discouraged because of the 8% sell tax, which sucks the FTM into the Jackpot.

VAMP is a true deflationary token only on FTM.
